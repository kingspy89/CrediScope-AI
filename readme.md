  **CrediScope-AI** is a Generative AI–powered credit assessment platform that analyzes and predicts creditworthiness using advanced machine learning and large language models (LLMs). This project was developed for the **Gen AI Hackathon by Google** to demonstrate a smarter, transparent, and explainable AI-driven financial evaluation system.

  ---

  ## 🚀 Overview

  Traditional credit scoring models rely on fixed criteria and often fail to capture the complexity of real-world financial behavior. CrediScope-AI combines predictive ML models with generative LLMs to provide not just a score — but an explanation and human-readable recommendations for each assessment.

  Key goals:
  - Produce a probabilistic credit risk prediction.
  - Provide explainability (XAI) for predictions so end users can understand the "why".
  - Offer generative summaries and recommendations from LLMs.
  - Make the system easy to integrate via a REST API and a frontend dashboard.

  ## 🧠 Tech Stack

  | Layer | Technology Used |
  |-------|------------------|
  | Frontend | React (Vite) + TypeScript + TailwindCSS |
  | Backend | Python 3 + FastAPI + Uvicorn |
  | AI / ML | scikit-learn, TensorFlow (optional), OpenAI/Gemini APIs (LLMs) |
  | Database | SQLite (default) / PostgreSQL (optional) |
  | Visualization | Plotly / Matplotlib / Seaborn |
  | Deployment | Docker / Google Cloud Platform (GCP) |

  ## 📁 Project Layout (important files)

  - `backend/` — FastAPI backend, models, services, and a small launcher (`run.py`).
    - `backend/run.py` — quick-start script that launches the FastAPI server using Uvicorn.
    - `backend/requirements.txt` — Python dependencies for the backend.
    - `backend/app/` — core application package (config, routes, services).
  - `frontend/` — Vite + React frontend app. Run with `npm run dev`.

  ---

  ## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

  Below are step-by-step instructions for running the backend and frontend locally on Windows PowerShell. Commands are PowerShell-friendly.

  Prerequisites:
  - Git
  - Python 3.10+ (recommended)
  - Node.js 18+ and npm / yarn
  - (Optional) Docker for containerized runs

  ### 1) Clone the repository

  ```powershell
  git clone https://github.com/kingspy89/CrediScope-AI.git
  cd CrediScope-AI
  ```

  ### 2) Backend (Python / FastAPI)

  Open a PowerShell terminal and run:

  ```powershell
  cd backend
  # Create and activate a virtual environment (PowerShell)
  python -m venv .venv
  . .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
  pip install --upgrade pip
  pip install -r requirements.txt

  # Start the API server (development):
  python run.py
  ```

  After startup you should see logs like:
  - API docs: http://localhost:<PORT>/docs
  - Health check: http://localhost:<PORT>/health

  Notes:
  - Configuration is read from `backend/app/config.py` (for example ports, debug mode, and allowed origins).
  - If you prefer using an explicit Uvicorn command, you can run:

  ```powershell
  uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080 --reload
  ```

  ### 3) Frontend (Vite + React)

  Open a separate terminal and run:

  ```powershell
  cd frontend
  npm install
  npm run dev
  ```

  The frontend dev server will usually run on http://localhost:5173 (Vite default). The backend origin can be set in environment or in `backend/app/config.py` as `FRONTEND_ORIGIN`.

  ### 4) Docker (optional)

  There is a `backend/Dockerfile` included for building a containerized backend. Example quick steps:

  ```powershell
  # From repo root
  cd backend
  docker build -t crediscope-ai-backend .
  docker run -p 8080:8080 crediscope-ai-backend
  ```

  Adjust port mapping and environment variables as necessary.

  ## 🔌 API Endpoints

  Key endpoints available in the backend (see `backend/app/routes`):
  - `GET /health` — health check
  - `GET /` or `/docs` — interactive Swagger UI (FastAPI auto docs)
  - Analysis endpoints are under `routes/` (e.g., `text_analysis`, `image_analysis`, `url_analysis`). Use the API docs to explore payload shapes.

  ---

  ## 🧪 Testing

  There are minimal tests / scripts included (for example `backend/test_mcp_server.py`). To run tests you can use `pytest` if you add test dependencies. A quick manual check is:

  1. Start backend
  2. curl or hit the `/health` endpoint

  Example (PowerShell):

  ```powershell
  Invoke-WebRequest -Uri http://localhost:8080/health -UseBasicParsing
  ```

  ---

  ## ✅ Usage Examples

  - Use the frontend to submit an analysis job and view the generative summary and model explanation.
  - Or call backend endpoints directly from your application to integrate the scoring functionality.

  ---

  ## 🛡️ Security & Privacy

  - The project is a demo/prototype. Do not use as-is for production financial decisions without a full compliance, security, and fairness audit.
  - If you integrate external LLM or API keys (OpenAI / Gemini), store keys securely (env vars, secret manager) and avoid committing them to source control.

  ## 🧭 Contribution

  Contributions are welcome. Suggested workflow:

  1. Fork the repository.
  2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feat/your-feature`.
  3. Add tests and update docs where appropriate.
  4. Open a PR with a clear description and screenshots if UI changes exist.

  Please follow repository conventions (code style, linting). Frontend uses ESLint and Tailwind; backend follows Python styles in `requirements.txt`.
